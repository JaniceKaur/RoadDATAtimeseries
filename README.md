# ROAD Time Series Data

Dataset  :  10 year Dataset from an IOT Sensor which is divided according to sections of road.\n
Aim  :  Predict Para 9-13 for year 10 for all sections and minimize RMSE.

Models Used  :  Random Forest Regressor(RMSE 46.9) and Extra Trees Regressor(RMSE 41.9)\n
Results  :  Extra Tree Regressor gives better results
